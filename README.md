# Dashdoc Mobile Interview

## Goal

Your goal is to build a react native app that will display gifs that the Giphy API returns for a given keyword.

The app should have 2 main screens: 
 - the main screen, with a search bar, displaying the most recent gifs for the keywords in the search bar, fetched from the Giphy API
 - a detail view of one gif, showing the gif in a bigger size and the name of the gif

The main screen should have a button to refresh the list.
